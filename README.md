# Pizza Sales Analytics with Excel and SQL

## Introduction 
Welcome to our pizza sales analysis project, where we will look into the world of pizza sales data to discover valuable insights and trends. In this project, we want to use data analytics techniques to gain a comprehensive understanding of our pizza business's performance. We aim to gain a better understanding of our business operations by analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, average order value, total pizzas sold, and other metrics.

Furthermore, by visualizing our data using various charts, such as daily and hourly trends for total orders, sales distribution by pizza category and size, and identifying top and bottom-selling pizzas, we hope to uncover actionable insights to drive business growth and optimization.

**Problem Statement: KPI's Requirement**

To effectively analyze our pizza sales data and gain insights into our business performance, we need to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) as follows:

1. **Total Revenue:** Sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
2. **Average Order Value:** Average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing total revenue by the total number of orders.
3. **Total Pizzas Sold:** Sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.
4. **Total Orders:** Total number of orders placed.
5. **Average Pizzas Per Order:** Average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.

**Problem Statement: Charts Requirement**

To visualize various aspects of our pizza sales data and understand key trends, we require the following charts:

1. **Daily Trend for Total Orders:** Bar chart displaying the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period.
2. **Hourly Trend for Total Orders:** Line chart illustrating the hourly trend of total orders throughout the day.
3. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category:** Pie chart showing the distribution of sales across different pizza categories.
4. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size:** Pie chart representing the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes.
5. **Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category:** Funnel chart presenting the total number of pizzas sold for each pizza category.
6. **Top 5 Best Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold:** Bar chart highlighting the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on the total number of pizzas sold.
7. **Bottom 5 Worst Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold:** Bar chart showcasing the bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas based on the total number of pizzas sold.
